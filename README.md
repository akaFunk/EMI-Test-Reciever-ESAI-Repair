# Adapters for capacitor replacemnt in an Rohde & Schwarz EMI Test Receiver ESAI
We got an old Rohde & Schwarz EMI Test Receiver ESAI which needed a little repair. The device did not boot when turning it on. Just a few LEDs switched on and nothing more happend. It turned out that two capacitors were shorting one of the power rails. Additionally the responsible fuse was blown. We decided to replace all capacitors to be on the safe side. The file ReplacementCaps.ods gives an overview of the capacitors in the two devices and the possible replacement parts. For the values 4700, 10000 and 2200 µF we were able to find fitting replacements. For the capacitors with the values 15000 and 470 µF we had to use replacements with different footprints. Two PCBs were designed to adapt the two different footprints to the original ones.
